Standart Step calculation in trapezoidal and rectangular open channel
Standart Step calculation for trapezoidal and rectangular open channel in MAT-LAB. In this MAT-LAB file, analysis can be made for 2 different unit systems, 2 different channel geometries. The information you need to provide for analysis; discharge, channel geometry, Manning n value, slope, initial water height and distance between two points. The information you need to provide for analysis; flow, channel geometry, Manning n value, slope, initial water height and distance between two points. Then the analysis gives you the height of the distance you want by analyzing in 2 steps for a maximum of 3 intervals at the same time.
You can also see information such as flow type and flow profile in the results of the analysis.
Since the code file works with the images given in the RAR file, the code file and the images must be in the same location. These images have been added to provide information about the information requested during the analysis and to show the type of flow.
